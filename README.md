=-=-= TacoTime Game Engine Overview =-=-=

This is the TacoTime game engine. It simulates running a coffee shop (or a Taco 
Truck...or any other fast food sort of thing). It is inspired by a variety of 
Flash and Symbian/JavaME games which allowed the player to assume a customer-
service type role. The players is the sole employee of a restaurant/cafe
consisting of a number of machines, which can be used to produce various
food items. Customers queue up at the front of the establishment and voice 
(well, display) their orders. The player attempts to fulfill the orders
in the least amount of time, aquiring points and money in the process.
