        <h2>Coffee Time</h2>

<p>Coffee Time is a cafe simulation casual game. As the cafe operator, you run a cafe, where you serve your customers coffee, blended drinks, cakes, and the like. The goal of the game is to serve as many customers as quickly as possible. The more customers you serve, the more points and money you get, which can be used to upgrade your cafe! As the game goes on the cafe becomes more popular and serves more customers. But be careful! With greater popularity comes greater challenge, as customers demand that you serve them quickly and exactly as you asked, and the days become longer and longer to satisfy customer demand.</p>
