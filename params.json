{"tagline":"Cafe Simulation Casual Game","body":"## Coffee Time\r\nCoffeeTime is a cafe simulation casual game. As the cafe operator, you run a cafe, where you serve your customers coffee, blended drinks, cakes, and the like. The goal of the game is to serve as many customers as quickly as possible. The more customers you serve, the more points and money you get, which can be used to upgrade your cafe! As the game goes on the cafe becomes more popular and serves more customers. But be careful! With greater popularity comes greater challenge, as customers demand that you serve them quickly and exactly as you asked, and the days become longer and longer to satisfy customer demand.\r\n\r\n![screenshots!](https://raw.github.com/iyulaev/tacotime/master/web/screenshot_collage.png)\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nThere is not a binary of Coffee Time currently available for download! We'll post a version ASAP, probably in APK form. Our goal is to get this thing into the Google Play store in the very beginning of 2013.\r\n\r\nYou can always download the full source from the [Coffee Time github project](https://github.com/iyulaev/tacotime).\r\n\r\n## The Team\r\n\r\nCoffee Time was programmed by a Real Programmer, with artwork by a Real Artist and music by a Real, Record-Making Musician! The game was designed by Ivan Yulaev (github: [iyulaev](https://github.com/iyulaev); Ivan was responsible for managing the project as well as defining the mechanics of the game, and then translating this into a Java codebase. [Megan Chiu](https://www.facebook.com/mgchiu) created the bulk of the artwork used in the final game, and [Ryan Warner-Steel](https://www.facebook.com/destrega) composed the Original Soundtrack used in Coffee Time.\r\n\r\n## Source\r\n\r\nFull source, including all game content, is available from the [Coffee Time github project](https://github.com/iyulaev/tacotime). Coffee Time is open source! Feedback on the code would be welcome, and we'd love to hear about your experience leveraging any part of the codebase!\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nAll software is released under BSD license, see the README.md for full license text.\r\n\r\nAll original artwork and all music & sound effects are released under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) license.\r\n\r\nSelected 3rd party artwork property of respective owners.\r\nCoffee cup icon: Property of Aha-Soft, http://www.aha-soft.com/\r\nCoffee cup background for menus: Property of Filippo, http://www.flickr.com/people/fdiotalevi/\r\nMicrowave, sandwich, speakers, trashcan, and some other artwork taken from WP Clipart (http://www.wpclipart.com/).
